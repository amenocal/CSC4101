This is our first submsssion of Project 2. There are very few methods missing, but all arithmetic operators , evaluation operators, etc. work correctly.
There is an extremely small workaround our project requires at this moment. Hopefully should be finished very soon. Seen in **NOTE.

**NOTE: Problem with numbers. When the last argument is a number. (Ex: (b+ 1 2) there is a small issue with lookahead. When entering a statement like this, will require one of the following.
1. A space, " " between the number and RPAREN. Ex: (b+ 1 2 ) 
2. An extra RPAREN after the statement. Ex: (b+ 1 2))  
Just a small problem, should be fixed soon but other than this detail, everything should be working fine.
